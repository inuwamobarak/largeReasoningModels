My collection of Large Reasoning Models(LRMs)

LRMs are the new approach open to research to improve the working performance of LLMs to give then the long desired ability to reason instead of just predicting next tokens.

1. [Marco-o1 Model](https://github.com/inuwamobarak/largeReasoningModels/tree/main/Marco-01):
- [Marco-o1](https://github.com/inuwamobarak/largeReasoningModels/tree/main/Marco-01
) is a large language model developed by the MarcoPolo Team at Alibaba International Digital Commerce, focusing on open-ended reasoning tasks beyond standard disciplines like mathematics and coding.
- It leverages Chain-of-Thought fine-tuning, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and innovative reasoning strategies to enhance its problem-solving capabilities.
- The model has shown significant improvements in accuracy on multilingual datasets and excels in translating colloquial expressions.
